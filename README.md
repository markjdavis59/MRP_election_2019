## MRP_election_2019
This repository contains the data and an R Markdown file for a Multi-Level Regression and Post-stratification analysis of the Australian 2019 federal election results.

There are three data files: 

- aes19_amended.csv is the 2019 Australian Election Study dataset
- Census3.csv contains 2016 ABS Census data for Commonwealth Electoral Divisions according to 2019 electoral boundaries
- election2019.csv has the 2019 two-party preferred election results by Division.

The R Markdown file MRP-preferred-model.Rmd is used to carry out the MRP analysis.
